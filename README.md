    - Invokes pullParams() and assigns to a ‘params’ var
    - Sends a GET request to /house/${params.id} to retrieve information about the house
      - Primary purpose is to find the coordinates to use as a center point for the map

  - pullParams()
    - Parsing function to parse parameters passed into the url

  - initializeMap()
    - Creates a new Google Map with a center point based on the current state of location

  - getShopAndEatMarkers()
    - Sends a GET request to Yelp based on the current location
      - Then invokes createShopAndEatMarkers
      - And sets the state of currentPlaces

  - createShopAndEatMarkers(array)
    - Takes an array of businesses generated by the Yelp API and for each business creates: 1). A marker, 2). An infoWindow 3). An event listener for mousing over the infowindow, 4). An event listener for mousing out of the infoWindow.
    - Icons are determined based on the first recognized category
    - Also sets the state for shopAndEatMarkers

  - basicMap()
    - Sets state of the ‘basic’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.
    - Invokes clearAllMarkers
    - If the modal is not hidden - toggles the modal (closes it)


  - toggleModal()
    - Changes the state of modalVisible to hide or show the modal.
    - Checks the state of modalVisible
    - Sets the state of modalVisible to its opposite

  - showState()
    - Helper function useful for debugging.
    - Displays App’s current state.

  - shopAndEatMap()
    - Sets state of the ‘shopAndEat’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.
    - Invokes getShopAndEatMarkers()
    - Toggles modal if modal is hidden

  - streetViewMap()
    - Skeleton function (i.e. needs further development)
    - Sets state of the ‘streetView’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.
    - Invokes clearAllMarkers
    - Toggles modal if modal is hidden

  - schoolsMap()
    - Skeleton function (i.e. needs further development)
    - Sets state of the ‘schools’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.

  - crimeMap()
    - Skeleton function (i.e. needs further development)
    - Sets state of the ‘crime’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.
    - Invokes clearAllMarkers
    - Toggles modal if modal is hidden

  - commuteMap()
    - Skeleton function (i.e. needs further development)
    - Sets state of the ‘commute’ key in currentMapView, and sets all other keys to false.
    - Invokes clearAllMarkers
    - Toggles modal if modal is hidden

  - clearAllMarkers()
